# Machine Learning Algorithms and Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning algorithms** and several **end-to-end ML projects**, organized in separate folders for clarity and ease of navigation.  

The goal of this repo is to provide both **implementations of core algorithms** from scratch or using libraries, and **complete pipelines** that cover data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **tool_box_projects/**  
  Contains implementations of different ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.).

- **end_to_end_projects/**  
  End-to-end ML projects that include dataset preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and results visualization.

Each folder has its own README (if needed) and code/scripts for better organization.

## ü§ñ Implemented Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of several ML algorithms.  
Below you can find a short description and visualization for each one.

### üîπ Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF Kernel

The **SVM with RBF kernel** is capable of handling non-linear decision boundaries by mapping the input space into a higher-dimensional feature space.  
The visualization below shows how the RBF kernel separates two classes and adapts to complex data distributions.

The trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using the **RBF kernel** effectively separates the two classes in the feature space. The decision boundary clearly adapts to the non-linear distribution of the data, highlighting the regions corresponding to each class. Support vectors, which are critical in defining this boundary, are visibly positioned along the edges of the class clusters. This visualization confirms the model's capability to handle complex patterns and provides an intuitive understanding of how SVM leverages support vectors to maximize the margin between classes.
