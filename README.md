# Machine Learning Algorithms and Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Machine Learning algorithms** and several **end-to-end ML projects**, organized in separate folders for clarity and ease of navigation.

The goal of this repo is to provide both **implementations of core algorithms** from scratch or using libraries, and **complete pipelines** that cover data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **tool_box_projects/**  
  Contains implementations of different ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.).

- **end_to_end_projects/**  
  End-to-end ML projects that include dataset preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and results visualization.

Each folder has its own README (if needed) and code/scripts for better organization.

## 🤖 Implemented Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of several ML algorithms.  
Below you can find a short description and visualization for each one.

### 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF Kernel

The **SVM with RBF kernel** is capable of handling non-linear decision boundaries by mapping the input space into a higher-dimensional feature space.  
The visualization below shows how the RBF kernel separates two classes and adapts to complex data distributions.

### 🔹 Naive Bayes Classifier

The **Naive Bayes classifier** is a probabilistic model based on Bayes’ theorem with the assumption of conditional independence between features.  
It is widely used in text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis due to its simplicity and efficiency.

Below is an example output visualization from the notebook:
